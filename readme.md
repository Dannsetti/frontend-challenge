# Frontend Challenge

Build a page that fetches an array of posts using: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and displays each of these posts on the page with basic formatting.

You can use any JS framework/packages to accomplish this challenge. We are looking more at your approach rather than the end result.

Bonus points if you make each div/post clickable. When clicked the post should either open on a separate page or in a modal/alert box on the same page.
